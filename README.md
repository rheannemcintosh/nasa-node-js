## Project Overview

NASA Mission Control is a Node.js application, which allows you to schedule a "mission" to one of the Kepler Exoplanets, and view upcoming missions, as well as those in the past.

### Inspiration
The original application was inspired by a tutorial on the ZTM Course, [Complete NodeJS Developer in 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-nodejs-developer-zero-to-mastery/).
